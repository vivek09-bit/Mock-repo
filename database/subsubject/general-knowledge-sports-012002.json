It started off as a regular match. Vince then changed it to No Holds Barred so Dude Love can use weapons. Finally he changed it to Falls Count Anywhere. That happened when Love had Austin knocked out while outside the ring. Since Vince is the owner and assigned himself as referee he could do what he wants. After all of that, Austin still retained his title that night."
