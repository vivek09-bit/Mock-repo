        "options": {
            "A": "The gate transistors are silicon (S), and the gates therefore have lower values of leakage current.",
            "B": "The S denotes the fact that a single gate is present in the IC rather than the usual package of 2â€“6 gates.",
            "C": "The S denotes a slow version of the device, which is a consequence of its higher power rating.",
            "D": "The devices use Schottky transistors and diodes to prevent them from going into saturation; this results in faster turn on and turn off times, which translates into higher frequency operation."
