There is noinit()method in theThreadclass.Option C is wrong. Therun()method of a thread is like the main() method to an application. Starting the thread causes the object's run method to be called in that separately executing thread.Option D is wrong. Theresume()method is deprecated. It resumes a suspended thread."
