It is similar to thebytearraydata type, but it is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed after it is created. While thebytestype can hold character data, it is not specifically designed to represent a sequence of characters like thestrdata type.Thecomplexdata type in Python is used to represent complex numbers, which are numbers with a real and imaginary part (e.g., 3 + 4j).
