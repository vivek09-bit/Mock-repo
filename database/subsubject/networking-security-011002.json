When filtering to an upper-layer protocol, you must use an extended list, numbers 100-199 and 2000-2699. Also, when you filter to an upper-layer protocol, you must use eithertcporudpin the protocol field. If it saysipin the protocol field, you cannot filter to an upper-layer protocol. SMTP uses TCP."
