Clearly, the cubes shown in figures (2) and (4) cannot be formed since they have the shaded face adjacent to the face bearing a dot and the cube shown in fig.

Also, the face bearing the 'x' sigh lies opposite to the face bearing the black circle and the face bearing the white circle lies opposite to the face bearing the square (having a dot inside it). Now, the cubes in figures (2) and (4) consist of faces which are not formed when the sheet in fig. (X) is folded. Hence, these two cubes are not, formed. Therefore, only the cubes in figures (1) and (3) are formed."
