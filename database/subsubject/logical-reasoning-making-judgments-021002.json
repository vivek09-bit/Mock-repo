There is nothing to suggest that Marilyn (choice a) or James (choice c) would be a good fit for Dr.Miller's practice. Kathy (choice d) has experience and she  is also interested in working with children. However, the fact that she hopes  to become a preschool teacher in the not-too-distant future indicates that she might not be the kind of committed, long-term employee that Dr. Miller needs. Lindy (choice b), with her hands-on experience working with children as well as  a degree from a prestigious dental hygiene program, is the most attractive candidate for the position based on the situation described"
