That means you are always allowed to declare a reference variable of the superclass type and have that reference variable refer to an instance of a subclass type, which in this case is an anonymous subclass ofBar. Since Bar is a subclass ofBoo, it all works.Option A is incorrect because it passes an int to theBooconstructor, and there is no matching constructor in theBooclass.Option C is incorrect because it violates the rules of polymorphismâ€”you cannot refer to a superclass type using a reference variable declared as the subclass type. The superclass is not guaranteed to have everything the subclass has.Option D uses incorrect syntax."
