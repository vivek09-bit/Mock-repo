        "answer_description": "You must be able to take a binary number and convert it into both decimal and hexadecimal. \nTo convert to decimal, just add up the 1s using their values. The values that are turned on with \nthe binary number of10110111are128 + 32 + 16 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 183. To get the hexadecimal \nequivalent, you need to break the eight binary digits into nibbles (4 bits),1011and0111. By add-\ning up these values, you get11and7. In hexadecimal,11isB, so the answer is0xB7."
